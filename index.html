        <p>
        Every day, your team's expertise and dedication ensure the animals in your care thrive. But as zoos and
        aquariums continue to evolve, meeting the growing expectations for animal wellbeing and guest
        engagement requires fresh perspectives and innovative approaches. The Enriched Experience Project,
        developed by AWARE Institute in partnership with San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and the Santa Barbara
        Zoo, can help you reach these goals.</p>
        <p>This program is designed to elevate your animal care practices, building on your team's strengths with
        onsite workshops and virtual support that deliver science-backed tools and strategies. By refining
        enrichment practices through an outcome-based care approach, the program helps your staff create
        sensory-rich, dynamic environments where animals can express natural behaviors and exercise
        agency—unlocking wellbeing and vitality that guests can see and feel.</p>
        <h4>Why Enriched Experiences Matter:</h4>
        <ul class="list-default-ul">
            <li>Animal Wellbeing: Thriving animals are the heart of every zoo's mission. Enriched experiences
                enhance their lives and support their natural instincts.</li>
            <li>Staff Empowerment: Your care team is the engine of innovation. This program fosters creativity,
                collaboration, and pride in their work, equipping them with actionable skills to make an
                immediate impact.</li>
            <li>Guest Inspiration: When animals thrive, their behaviors captivate and inspire guests, deepening
                emotional connections and advancing your conservation goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        With AWARE Institute's collaborative approach, we'll help you achieve meaningful, measurable results
        that amplify your commitment to animal wellbeing, energize your staff, and inspire your visitors.
        Let's partner to create a future where every animal thrives, and every visitor leaves inspired.</p>

        <h3>Transforming Zoo Habitats: Small Changes, Big Impact</h3>
        <div class="spotlight-image">

        <div class="spotlight-text"> 
        
        <p>Every habitat tells a story—of the animals it houses, the care it represents, and the connections it
        fosters. But as expectations evolve, zoos face the challenge of keeping older exhibits relevant while
        balancing limited resources. At AWARE Institute, we believe that meaningful improvements don't always
        require a major overhaul.</p>
        <p>
        Our Habitat Assessment &amp; Refinement Service helps zoos breathe new life into existing spaces. Using a
        science-based, practical approach, we work alongside your team to identify creative, cost-effective
        enhancements that improve animal wellbeing and inspire guest engagement. From reimagining how
        spaces are used to introducing innovative management practices, we focus on solutions that are
        thoughtful and impactful.</p>

        <ul class="list-default-ul">
            <li>Animal Wellbeing: Animals thrive in dynamic, thoughtfully enriched environments. Small
                changes can unlock big opportunities for natural behaviors and mental stimulation.</li>
                <li>Guest Connection: Engaging, vibrant habitats spark curiosity, foster empathy, and leave a lasting
                    impression, strengthening your mission to inspire conservation action.</li>
                <li>Legacy and Vision: By enhancing existing exhibits, you demonstrate adaptability and forward-
                    thinking leadership, preserving your zoo's legacy while paving the way for future innovation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        This service empowers zoos to maximize their impact today while building confidence and momentum
        for the future. With AWARE Institutes collaborative support, you can ensure your habitats reflect the
        very best of your dedication to animals, staff, and community.</p>
        <p>Together, let's turn yesterday's exhibits into tomorrow's inspirations.</p>

                <h2>Cheryl Meehan, Ph.D.</h2>
                
                <p><strong> Cheryl Meehan has spent over two decades pushing the boundaries of animal wellbeing through
                    cutting-edge research, education, and transformative solutions.</strong> Her journey began with companion
                    parrots, leading groundbreaking projects like the National Parrot Relinquishment Research Project for
                    PetsMart Charities, where she unraveled the complexities of ownership trends and relinquishment.
                    In 2014, Cheryl founded AWARE Institute, a hub for innovation at the intersection of animal welfare
                    science, professional development, and habitat design. From pioneering software tools that drive
                    welfare outcomes to publishing influential research on stereotypic behavior and enrichment, Cheryl has
                    become a trusted leader in her field. She’s also partnered with architecture firms to inject animal
                    wellbeing expertise into habitat design, assessment, and master planning, ensuring spaces inspire both
                    animals and humans.
                    Cheryl’s influence spans large-scale initiatives like the Using Science to Understand Zoo Elephant Welfare
                    project, which assessed nearly the entire AZA elephant population, to zoo-specific studies exploring
                    guest perceptions and the transformative power of enriched animal experiences on behavior, empathy,
                    and conservation action.
                    
                    A champion of collaboration, Cheryl is passionate about helping clients amplify their impact, blending
                    science, creativity, and communication to bring their vision to life. Cheryl is dedicated to driving
                    meaningful change for animals and the people who care for them./p>
